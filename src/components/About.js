          <p>
            I'm someone who is passionate about a wide range of things, from technology to entertainment. Outside of technology, I love staying active through boxing and, of course, enjoying good food! I'm a huge fan of Batman, and when I'm not diving into the world of coding or AI, you’ll often find me watching movies or playing video games. Building websites is something I love doing in my free time, and I’m constantly exploring new ways to improve my skills.

            AI has always fascinated me, especially when it comes to how it can enhance everyday life. Whether it's automation or personalized experiences, I’m excited about the future of AI and its potential.
